            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Dylan.I own a cat that makes me very happy despite his bipolar nature, I have included a photo of him due to my reluctancy to provide a photo of myself on a public repository. As you can probably tell from my last sentence i am very private individual, you will not find me on ANY social media platforms 
               with my name, and you will only find me on 3 social media platforms with aliases, only 1 of which that i post on, and i do so in a very private manner, this one platform would be snapchat.
               I am super interested in AI, or more specifically deep-learning, i absolutely love what AI is already capable of, and what it could be capable of if we took the reigns off per say, and 
               further improved existing models. Although i am interested in ai i am not so sure im interested in the ridiculous amount of education necessary to be a prominent member in the field,
               I hope to pursue a masters degree if finances permit me to, and with that i would like to develop my own ai models, and also work in a position that entails one of the following: AI development,
               blockchain development, back end web-server development(or other generally rigorous back end development work - as i enjoy challenging myself.).
