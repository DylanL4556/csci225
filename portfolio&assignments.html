            <p>Hello, I have some experience in regards to block-chain specifically.
            I also have experience writing in: Go, C++, Python, java, and JS, and rust.
            My favorite language to write in is Go, it is a language that is growing in its use-cases extraordinarily
            quickly, and i have enjoyed developing complex projects with it.
            I may include some projects i have written in the future, and probably a long list of (original) kata solutions as well.
            which will be in various languages.
            </p>
